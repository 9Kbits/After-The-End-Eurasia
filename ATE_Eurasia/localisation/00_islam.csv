nizari_DESC;The Nizaris are one of the last remaining sects of Isma'ilism, a branch of Shia Islam. Nizaris believe that the Agha Khan, a direct descendant of Ali, is the rightful leader of the Muslim world. The Agha Khan's lineage has remained unbroken despite the tumult of the Event, a fact that caused this sect to grow dramatically in size over the past few centuries. Nizaris are a relatively tolerant group by post-Event standards, and are generally accepting of intermarriage between other peoples of the book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

satpanthi_DESC;The Satpanthis are an offshoot of Nizari Islam that emerged from groups of Hindu converts to Islam. Satpanthis reject the authority of the Agha Khan and incorporate many Hindu symbols and traditions into their faith, with some even identifying as both Hindu and Muslim simultaneously. This syncretism has caused mainstream Nizaris to label them as heretics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
